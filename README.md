# Requirements Installation

You can install the requirements by using the command below:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For those who use different CPU architecture such as Apple Silicon M1/M2, you may encounter an issue with tensorflow. You can install it separately using conda, such as:

```
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
```
